        <p>Welcome to netandruescavapoos.co.uk. These Terms and Conditions ("T&Cs") govern your use of our website,
            services and content. By accessing and using our site, you expressly agree to these terms. If you do not
            agree with all provisions, please do not use our services.</p>

        <h2>How to Access and Responsibly Use the Services of netandruescavapoos.co.uk</h2>

            basis.</p>

        <h2>Strict Age Verification and Legal Compliance Policies</h2>
        <p>Our content is intended exclusively for persons who have reached the legal minimum age for gambling in their
            respective jurisdiction. In the United Kingdom and most countries, this minimum age is 18 years. By

            behaviour that may be considered harassing, threatening, fraudulent, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise
            unlawful or offensive is strictly prohibited. You may not disrupt, overload, or circumvent the security or
            integrity of the website's systems or processes.</p>

        <h2>Prohibited Behaviours and Robust Abuse Prevention</h2>

            means to access the website; reverse engineering or decompiling software; spreading malware; conducting DoS
            attacks; unauthorised collection of other users' data; and any action that violates applicable gambling

            control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of these websites.
            The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement, approval, or partnership with that third party. Access
            to linked websites is at the user's own risk.</p>

        <h2>Clear Guidelines on Account Suspension and Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion and without prior notice or liability, to deny, restrict, or
            terminate your access to this website or parts thereof for any reason, including but not limited to a
            violation of these T&Cs or applicable law. In the event of termination, all provisions of these T&Cs that by
            their nature should survive shall remain in effect, including but not limited to ownership provisions,
            disclaimers, and indemnities.</p>

        <h2>Definition of Liability, Legal Obligations and Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>Use of our website and its content is at your own risk. The website and all content are provided "as is" and
            "as available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We expressly disclaim all warranties,
            including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of third-party rights. We
